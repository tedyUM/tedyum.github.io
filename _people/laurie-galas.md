bio: I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Temporal Dynamics Lab with a keen interest in rhythms associated with Human perception. After a Bachelor of Biology, Animal Physiology and Neuroscience obtained at Université de Montpellier (France), I did a master (at Ecole Normale Supérieure, Université Paris Cité, École des Hautes études en Sciences Sociales in Paris, France) followed by a PhD in Cognitive Science (at Université Paris Cité) under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Laura Dugué. With expertise in neuroimaging (EEG, TMS, MRI) and psychophysics including dense sampling technique, my research has mainly focused on brain and behavioral spatio-temporal dynamics. During my Post Doc at Maastricht University, I will work on the relation between brain phases and behavioral performance. I plan to use real-time brain stimulation to investigate the causal role of brain activity on perception.

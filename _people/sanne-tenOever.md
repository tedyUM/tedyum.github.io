bio: I am a researcher interested in how the brain can track temporal information and uses temporal dynamics to organize neuronal communication. I have a Master Degree in Cognitive Neuroscience from Maastricht University. During my PhD (2012-2016) I have studied how rhythm and temporal information is used to optimize perception. I used primarily EEG, but also MEG and ECoG. I found that on the one hand we use temporal structure to optimally predict when something is going to happen. The brain pro-actively uses this temporal structure to adapt processing. However, temporal information also provides information about the exact content of information, that is temporal information does not only provide cues for when, but also for what. During my first postdoctoral position (2016-2019) I have dived deeper into fundamental principles of storing information that might have a temporal context. How can the brain track continuously incoming information but use the same temporal dimension to code information? In my second postdoc (2020-2022), my research focusses on the integration of temporal information in the context of language. Currenlty, I am head the Temporal Dynamics group and assistant professor at Maastricht University.

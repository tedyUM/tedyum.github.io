bio: As a Cognitive Neuroscience PhD candidate, I investigate the timing of neural interactions between sensory and frontal areas during perception. Using oscillatory electric stimulation (tACS), I aim to modulate neuronal temporal dynamics and record resulting patterns (EEG). My focus is on demonstrating neural entrainment during online and offline tACS stimulation and establishing a closed-loop tACS-EEG system. Previously, I obtained my Master's in Cognitive Neuroscience from Radboud University (2021-2023) and gained practical experience as a research assistant at the Donders Institute (2023-2024), where I implemented various stimulation and recording techniques (TMS, TUS, MRI, MEG, EEG).

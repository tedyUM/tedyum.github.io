bio: I am a PhD candidate at the Temporal Dynamics Lab and the Brain Stimulation and Cognition Lab at Maastricht University under supervision of Sanne ten Oever, Felix Duecker and Alexander Sack. I have a background in Biomedical Sciences and a master's degree specialising in Neuromodulation techniques. In my PhD, I focus on using multimodal neuroimaging (fMRI and EEG) and brain stimulation (TMS) to investigate phase-dependent representations in visual working memory.

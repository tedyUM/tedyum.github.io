bio: I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Temporal Dynamics Lab. My current research focuses on computational modeling of oscillatory mechanisms that describe inter-area brain communication. Specifically, I am interested in how the sensory cortex can optimally couple with both sensory input and frontal feedback. With a background in Electrical Engineering, I obtained my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Maastricht University. In 2023, I received my PhD degree under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Rainer Goebel and Dr. Mario Senden.  My PhD research primarily focused on mapping the visual cortex using efficient computational methods and models. Additionally, I am keenly drawn to data-driven discovery of models and dynamics that can provide new insights into the functioning of the brain.

bio: I am a PhD candidate at the Temporal Dynamics Lab. My research interests particularly lie in temporal memory processes. Presently, I am working on a project which investigates the theta-gamma neuronal code and associative memory by using a closed-loop EEG system. Obtaining a bachelor’s degree in psychology and research master degree in Cognitive Neuroscience has shaped my fascination for Cognitive Neuroscience. Building upon this foundation, I am currently a PhD student at this group.

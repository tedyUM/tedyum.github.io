bio:
I am a research intern at the Temporal Dynamics Lab as part of my Research Master programme. My research interests particularly lie in temporal memory processes. Presently, I am working on my thesis project, which investigates the theta-gamma neuronal code and associative memory by using a closed-loop EEG system. Obtaining a bachelor’s degree in psychology has shaped my fascination for Cognitive Neuroscience. Building upon this foundation, I am currently a second year Research Master student in Cognitive Neuroscience at Maastricht University, which is known for its problem-based learning. This approach gave me the opportunity to collaborate with others and to develop a solution-oriented, while at the same time critical mindset.

## Temporal dynamics inside and outside the brain

Rhythm and temporal information is used to optimize perception. We use temporal structure to optimally predict when something is going to happen. The brain pro-actively uses this temporal structure to adapt processing. However, temporal information also provides information about the exact content of information, that is temporal information does not only provide cues for when, but also for what. For both operations (tracking and coding temporal information) it seems that the same temporal brain dynamics are important, namely brain oscillations.

How can the brain track continuously incoming information but use at the same time the same temporal dimension to code information? To do this the brain needs to compute in time as well as  with time.

Our group investigates how our brain can track temporal structure and how temporal dynamics in the brain are relevant for various cognitive functions such as memory, speech, and attention. We use EEG, but also MEG, EcoG, brain stimulation, and more recently computational modeling.

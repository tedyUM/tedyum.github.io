bio: I am a student enrolled in the Master's program of Biomedical Sciences at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, specializing in neuromodulation. I am currently doing a research internship within the Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, where my focus is on investigating the effects of amplitude-modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS) on the oscillatory coupling mechanism in the human brain. My academic journey led me here after successfully completing the University Foundation Program (UFP) at the Bell School in Cambridge. Seeking an international educational experience, I found Maastricht University to be an ideal fit, given its commitment to problem-based learning (PBL). This approach has equipped me with the skills to work collaboratively and independently, fostering critical thinking.

Oscillations are time-varying dynamic in the brain which can easily be observed by EEG. An oscillation reflect modulations of excitability shifting from high to low excitability. This excitability change allows for the tracking of temporally structured patterns in the environment, such as music or speech, by aligning input to high excitable phases of an oscillation.

Besides tracking, oscillations also to provide a temporal organizational principle in the brain to structure neural firing. Depending on the excitability of individual neuronal populations, neurons will be active at different moments of an ongoing oscillations. It is likely that there would be a complete chaos of neural firing when oscillations are absent.

These two functions of oscillations - temporal tracking and temporal coding - do not always live in harmony with each other. For example how does the brain use oscillations to structure input arriving at the same moment? Or does the time at which information arrives on an oscillations influence which neuronal population is activated? In this research line we investigate both functions as well as the interaction of these functions.

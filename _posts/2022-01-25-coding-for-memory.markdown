In this research line I investigate the role of oscillations in organizing memory operations working in parallel. There has been a proposal that when you have to memorize multiple items that oscillations might sort the different items along the excitability axis of an oscillation [(Lisman & Jensen, 2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627313002316).

There are a lot of open questions regarding this proposal. I would like to investigate whether the ordering is either related to the level of excitability (and thereby memory strength) of individual items? Alternatively, the phase of the coding might be related to either a specific order of external events or the exact timing. These are open question I would like to pursue further.

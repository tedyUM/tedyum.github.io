## Research lines

The relevance of temporal information and temporal coding is important for many cognitive domains. Our research group has the following research lines.
### [Temporal tracking versus temporal coding](/main/research/lines/2022/01/24/tracking-versus-coding.html)

In this research line we investigate two different proposed roles of oscillations and their interaction. We study how oscillations can both be important to track temporal dynamics in the environment, but also are relevant for coding different representations.

### [Speech and language](/main/research/lines/2022/01/24/speech-and-language.html)

In this research line we investigate the temporal dynamics in speech. Specifically we are interested to investigate how speech temporal dynamics interact with the content of speech.

### [Temporal coding for memory](/main/research/lines/2022/01/24/coding-for-memory.html)

In this research line we investigate the role of neural oscillations in organizing memory operations.

In this research we will investigate anticipatory mechanisms that foster communication between frontal and sensory cortex during perception. The goal is to better understand this communication using computational modelling, EEG and EcoG as well as develop a new closed-loop EEG-tACS set-up that can mimic anticipatory brain operations.

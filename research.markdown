## Research lines

The relevance of temporal information and temporal coding is important for many cognitive domains. I can divide my research in the following research lines
### [Temporal tracking versus temporal coding](/main/research/lines/2022/01/24/tracking-versus-coding.html)

### [Speech and language](/main/research/lines/2022/01/24/speech-and-language.html)

### [Temporal coding for memory](/main/research/lines/2022/01/24/coding-for-memory.html)

In this research we will investigate anticipatory mechanisms that foster communication between frontal and sensory cortex during perception. The goal is to better understand this communication using computational modelling, EEG and EcoG as well as develop a new closed-loop EEG-tACS set-up that can mimic anticipatory brain operations.
